August Cardsharp is an intentionally absurd contract trick-taking game based
primarily on Ulti and Mariáš, but also informed by Bridge, Tarock, Sixty-six,
and Magic: the Gathering. Its deck was created by May Emerson, and its rules
were created jointly by them and me (Maria Szegedy). Good luck playing the damn
thing. The deck has 2516 cards, and you need to shuffle 2286 of them together to
play.
