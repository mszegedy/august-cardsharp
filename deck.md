August Cardsharp's deck was originally conceived as a monolith consisting of
several series of interrelated cards with no higher organization besides the
suits, archsuits, oversuits, and card types, but the game rules necessitated
some further organization, leading to four broad types of cards:

- Quotidian cards, which comprise the player's main deck and source of cards.
- Horoscope cards, which comprise a second, smaller deck for the player, and are
  placed directly from the deck into play, rather than the player's hand.
- Ideal cards, which belong to no player, and are searched for rather than
  drawn.
- Invasive cards, which are distributed randomly among the quotidian and
  horoscope decks.

## Quotidian cards
The quotidian cards are distinguished by belonging to a long series of 60 suits.
The suits themselves belong to a series of 12 archsuits, which themselves belong
to a series of 3 oversuits. The hierarchy of suits is as follows (oversuits as
**headings**, archsuits in **bold**, and suits in normal text):

#### Metals
**Lead:** Keys, Locks, Chains, Doors, Castles  
**Bronze:** Hourglasses, Puzzle Pieces, Gears, Trumpets, Bells  
**Silver:** Spades, Clubs, Shields, Swords, Wands  
**Gold:** Books, Coins, Cups, Wheels, Crowns  
#### Flesh
**Blood:** Hands, Hearts, Paws, Eyes, Bones  
**Beasts:** Eagles, Foxes, Wolves, Rats, Spiders  
**Herbs:** Acorns, Leaves, Roses, Daisies, Lilies  
**Men:** Knights, Kings, Wild Men, Ladies, Judges  
#### Mysteries
**Heavens:** Flames, Crescents, Suns, Stars, Bolts  
**Forms:** Lemniscates, Spirals, Halos, Pentacles, Crosses  
**Stones:** Quartze, Teardrops, Diamonds, Pebbles, Prisms  
**Numbers:** Honeycombs, Ogdoad, Tetractyes, Quincunces, Myriad

Belonging to each suit are 30 number cards, in ascending rank: a Debtor's Ace
(-1), a half (½), an Ace (1), a Root of Two (√2), a Deuce (2), the whole numbers
three (3) through twenty-three (23), a hundred (100), a thousand (1,000), a
myriad (10,000), and Infinity (∞). Furthermore belonging to each suit, ranking
above the number cards, are 10 face cards, in ascending rank: the Maid, the
Dame, the Jack, the Cavalier, the Priestess, the Priest, the Princess, the
Prince, the Queen, and the King.

Besides the cards mentioned above belonging to distinct suits, there are 20
number cards per archsuit that belong to the archsuit itself, in multiples of
five, from five (5) to a hundred (100), and 16 face cards likewise belonging
therein, in ascending rank: the Sacrifice, the Traitor, the Fool, the Magician,
the Chariot, the Hermit, the Popess, the Emperor, the Empress, the Pope, the
Wheel, the Nymph, the Youth, the Lovers, the Antipope, and the Harlot.

Likewise, belonging to each oversuit are another series of cards: 12 number
cards in multiples of twenty, from twenty (20) to two hundred and forty (240),
and 4 face cards in ascending rank: the Devil, the Tower, the Hierophant, and
the Heresiarch.

Finally, belonging to _all_ suits, archsuits, and oversuits are 6 number cards
in multiples of sixty, from sixty (60) to three hundred and sixty (360).

The ranking of cards within a suit may be altered by the rules of the current
contract, or by the presence of a horoscope card on the field. This only applies
to suited cards; archsuited, oversuited, and all-suited cards will never have
their relative ranking altered, although the relative ranking of their suits
themselves, as is usual for trick-taking card games, is determined dynamically.

In total, the quotidian cards comprise 1,800 suited cards, 432 archsuited cards,
48 oversuited cards, and 6 all-suited cards, for a total of 2,286 quotidian
cards.

## Horoscope cards
Horoscope cards are simple in structure, being comprised of 62 constellation
cards, 62 star cards corresponding to the primary star of each constellation,
and 8 overseer cards. Constellations are labelled with the number of stars they
contain and the name of their primary star. These constellations and stars are:

The 8 overseer cards are the following unique all-suited face cards, in
ascending rank: the Star, the Moon, the Sun, the World, Judgement, Lightning,
Chaos, and Death. While other horoscope cards have nontrivial and
context-dependent gameplay purposes, overseer cards' only purpose is to be put
into play and win its player the current trick. They trump all other cards, and
their relative ranking only matters with respect to each other.

In total, the horoscope cards comprise 62 constellation cards, 62 star cards,
and 8 overseer cards, for a total of 132 cards.

## Ideal cards
Ideal cards are similar to quotidian cards in structure, but comprise only two
suits, Misery and Fortune, which belong to no archsuit or oversuit (or more
precisely, are treated as all three types of suit). They only come into play
when a player has met the conditions to "transform" a quotidian card into either
of its ideal counterparts. This is only possible for the archsuited and
oversuited face cards, as only they have corresponding ideal cards.

Explicitly, this list of included 16 face cards is, in ascending rank: the
Sacrifice, the Traitor, the Fool, the Magician, the Chariot, the Hermit, the
Popess, the Emperor, the Empress, the Pope, the Wheel, the Nymph, the Youth, the
Lovers, the Antipope, the Harlot, the Devil, the Tower, the Hierophant, and the
Heresiarch.

In total, the ideal cards comprise 2 suits of 16 cards each, for a total of 32
ideal cards.

## Invasive cards
Invasive cards are comprised of several thematically and structurally unrelated
series of cards, intended to neuter the consistency of the decks that they
invade. Their effects are highly context-dependent, but mostly uniformly
negative, the exception being the jokers. The invasive cards are comprised of
the jokers, the blanks, the elements, the virtues, and the vices.

The jokers and blanks are a series of 15 jokers and 3 blank cards. 14 of the 15
jokers are distinguished by their colors: red, yellow, orange, green, blue,
indigo, violet, rainbow, black, grey, white, bronze, silver, and golden. The
15th joker and the three blank cards are distinguished by their anomalous
printing (their names given in **bold**):

- **invisible joker, zero:** Normal card back, blank face.
- **absolute zero:** Blank card back, blank face.
- **wild card:** Card back on both sides.

The invisible joker and the zero card are completely identical and physically
interchangeable. During the game, during each round, the first person to play
one of the two cards printed in such a fashion may freely decide which of the
two it is; the other such card will then assume the other identity for the rest
of the round.

The elements are a series of 12 named, unranked cards: Fire, Air, Earth, Water,
Aether, Ether, Sulfur, Mercury, Salt, Wood, Lead, and Gold.

The virtues and vices are two parallel series of 16 named, unranked cards each.
Each virtue has a corresponding vice. This correspondence is:

- Temperance, Gluttony
- Fortitude, Cowardice
- Justice, Evil
- Prudence, Vainglory
- Strength, Weakness
- Hope, Despair
- Faith, Idolatry
- Charity, Avarice
- Chastity, Lust
- Diligence, Sloth
- Kindness, Envy
- Patience, Wrath
- Humility, Pride
- Unity, Discord
- Sobriety, Debauchery
- Good Works, Subversion

In total, the invasive cards comprise 15 jokers, 3 blanks, 12 elements, 16
virtues, and 16 vices, for a total of 62 invasive cards.
