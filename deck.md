August Cardsharp's deck was originally conceived as a monolith consisting of
several series of interrelated cards with no higher organization besides the
suits, archsuits, oversuits, and card types, but the game rules necessitated
some further organization, leading to four broad types of cards:

- Quotidian cards, which comprise the player's main deck and source of cards.
- Horoscope cards, which comprise a second, smaller deck for the player, and are
  placed directly from the deck into play, rather than the player's hand.
- Ideal cards, which belong to no player, and are searched for rather than
  drawn.
- Invasive cards, which are distributed randomly among the quotidian and
  horoscope decks.
