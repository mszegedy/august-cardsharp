## Beginning a game
### Seating, layout, and roles
(todo: round table, designate dealer, trick area in middle, decks in front of
each player)

### Organizing cards
The dealer organizes the quotidian cards, horoscope cards, ideal cards, and
invasive cards into one pile each. They then shuffle each pile, except for the
ideal cards, which they sort if it isn't already sorted.

(todo: explain how to shuffle large piles of cards)

### Forming the quotidian decks
The dealer gives each player 150 cards from the top of the shuffled quotidian
pile, counterclockwise, starting with the dealer's right hand neighbor, without
showing the other players. The players then select 90 of these cards to form
their quotidian decks. They shuffle their decks face down, and are no longer
allowed to inspect them.

### Forming the horoscope decks
The dealer removes the top 43Ã—N cards of the shuffled horoscope pile face down,
where N is the number of players. This collection of cards is then passed around
counterclockwise between the players, starting with the dealer's right hand
neighbor. Each player inspects the cards in the collection, selects a specific
number of cards from it for their horoscope deck without showing other players,
and passes the remainder to their right hand neighbor.

The number of cards the player selects is dependent on how many times they've
been passed the collection:

1. The first time, they select 1 card.
2. The second time, they select 7 cards.
3. The third time, they select 14 cards.

Once all players have received the collection three times, they are no longer
allowed to inspect their horoscope decks, and leave them face down. The
remaining cards are shuffled face down by the dealer, and the top 21 cards are
distributed to each player face down, counterclockwise, starting with the
dealer's right hand neighbor. The players then shuffle these last 21 cards
into their horoscope decks, all without inspecting them.

### Distributing the invasive cards
The dealer gives each player 10 cards from the top of the shuffled invasive pile
face down, counterclockwise, starting with the dealer's right hand neighbor.
Each player inspects them, then shuffles them into their quotidian decks.

The dealer then gives each player 5 more cards from the top of the shuffled
invasive pile face down, in the same order. Each player inspects them, then
shuffles them into their horoscope decks.

### The ideal cards
The ideal pile is placed next to the trick area, where it is easily accessible
by the dealer.

## Bidding
(todo: reveal a horoscope card from the top of your h-deck, cut the h-deck of
the player to your right, place card in middle)

## Beginning a round
(todo: 13 tricks, start w/ contract winner, shuffle, draw 7 and set aside 6 face
down, dividing deck into "top deck" and "bottom deck")
